          I hereby consent to the processing of my personal data in the form of
          data related to the dynamics of keystrokes while typing on a computer
          keyboard. These data will be collected and processed by students of
          the "Politechnika Rzeszowka imienia Ignacego ≈Åukasiewicza" for the
          purpose of analyzing and developing user recognition algorithms based
          on their typing style. The results of the study may be used for thesis
          projects, scientific publications, and conference presentations.

        <p class="dataConsent__description">
          Giving consent is completely voluntary and I can withdraw it at any
          time, which will result in the cessation of processing my data from
          the moment of withdrawal. Withdrawing consent does not affect the
          legality of the processing that was carried out on the basis of
          consent before its withdrawal.
